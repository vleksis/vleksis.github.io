# Introduction

Education gives breadth, mastery comes from depth, and first-principles work builds those edges.

# Pareto

Many people have heard about the Pareto principle.
80 percent of results come from 20 percent of the effort.
While this idea is hard to dispute, I believe that the remaining 20 percent is what truly distinguishes a professional from everyone else.

Most skills can be acquired by completing a university course that lasts about half a year (around 90-180 academic hours).
That may seem like a long time to learn a single skill, but it is far from enough to reach real expertise.
True masters spend years refining abilities that others consider “learned” after just one semester.

Some examples to make it sound less abstract

- many school attendants can pass a test of some subject they study, but not many of them will get professional education focusing that subject.
- All math student mandatory study calculus, but only few of them will read original papers.
- All computer science students will learn a programming language or few, but much less of them will become a good software architectures.

# Knowledge as a graph

In my view, people often have very different mental models of what knowledge is.
One useful way to think about it is as a graph.
The vertices represent axioms, definitions, statements, facts, and similar units of knowledge.
The edges represent relationships between them — logical implications, dependencies, and connections.

Why edges are better?
If you have seen a pattern of edges recurring in different vertices, you should try to move it to the new vertices.
There is a good chance to succeed.
Moreover, trying to append another edge to the graph, you can find yourself adding the edge to a unseen vertex.
Some vertices are, in fact, unreachable (Godel incompleteness theorem).
Also, there are a lot of vertices that humanity believe should be connected, however it is not proved yet.
I think such conjunctions are just failed attempts to hack that system.

At first glance, this may resemble note-taking systems such as Obsidian, Notion, or even Wikipedia.
There is some overlap, but the concepts are not the same.
A graph is simply a convenient and expressive model for describing both learning and knowledge accumulation.

Following this analogy, classic university course gives you mostly vertices.
In general, programs (not speaking about very special or high-end courses) include the most common and highly examined material.
After completing it you will have roughly 90% (just a random big enough number) of the vertices in place.
But the amount of edges is pretty limited in this type of education.

A great example to prove it is the Pythagoras theorem.
Everybody knows the statement $ a^2 + b^2 \eq c^2 $, many remembers a few proofs.
However, there are hundreds of known proofs and each of them is a art, that common education avoids. `the Pythagorean Proposition contains 370 proofs`
Of course, nobody really needs so many proofs.
But it depicts how many edges can pass through a single vertex.
Just take in head that each of proof highlights a different relationship: geometry, algebra or group theory.

# From scratch

```

```

When reading different kind of mathematic (computer science is some aspect of math to me) books and articles, I enjoy trying to prove the statements by myself before getting the solution.
Even if you fail this time, you gain the experience that will allow you to solve the next puzzle.
It gives a sparse amount of options to reflect why something is made the way it is made.
Or maybe better it is just a coincidence, and you can vary different aspects of the statement or prove to obtain different results.
That technique encourage the spirit of scientist and the discoverer.

Writing different soft from scratch.

The only drawback I found is that it consumes much more time then classic learning.
Considering that our time is limited, this is the serious one.
You can not understand everything from scratch - humanity as a kind spent millions of years to reach the current state.
You have to make a choice to prioritize some activity to others and steadily improve your skills.
However, I do not want you to lay all your life on the altar of a single skill.
Just find something that grabs your attention, give it much more time with other resources and let you enjoy your journey.
All I want to say is do not spread your attention because parents, curricular authors or your gpa claim you to be perfect at disparate fields.
